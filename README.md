# web_get_iplayer
a python wrapper to provide a web interface to get_iplayer 

Put the web_get_iplayer.py in your CGI-BIN directory, make it executable, and then access it via your web browser.
in theory, it will tell you what to do, what directories to create and what permissions to give them.

Note that if it doesn't run at all, run it at the command line to check python has all the libraries it needs.

You also need to have the get_iplayer.pl script installed too.
